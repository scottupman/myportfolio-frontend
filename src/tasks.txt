1. implement autocomplete feature on search bar (medium)
2. Determine if search results = 0 for autocomplete (medium)
3. (optional) look into why the error message for registration page on dob doesn't show if you select higher than max date
4. Implement user page showing credentials (medium)

After this you should be done :)
