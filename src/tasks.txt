1. Make sure that the buy feature is functioning properly on the UI

2. Make sure to correctly display the response message from the trade API call (look into the state variables)

3. Reset all state of the trade modal when you exit (store the inital state somewhere)

4. Make sure that when another trade occurs that a new alert displays (perhaps toggle the state of the openAlert state variable)
